# The Agency Protocol: Layer 1 - The Pre-Commit Phase

**A Whitepaper on Sensemaking Triage and Promise Architecture**

---

## Executive Summary

The Pre-Commit Phase represents the foundation of the Agency Protocol's three-phase promise cycle. While the Commit Phase installs promises into consciousness and Post-Commit extracts learning from execution, Pre-Commit determines which intentions warrant formalization into promises and structures those commitments for success. The quality of Pre-Commit work determines whether subsequent phases have adequate foundation or whether practitioners attempt to install and execute promises that were poorly conceived from the start.

This whitepaper addresses the reality that human beings face overwhelming arrays of possible commitments at any moment. Should one invest in health practices, career development, relationship deepening, creative projects, or community contribution? Each possibility presents itself as potentially valuable, yet pursuing all simultaneously guarantees failure through capacity fragmentation. The Pre-Commit Phase provides structured triage that separates high-value commitment opportunities from poor investments of limited capacity.

The phase recognizes that commitment decisions occur under genuine uncertainty. Practitioners cannot know with certainty whether a particular promise will yield anticipated outcomes. Life presents surprises, capacity estimates prove inaccurate, and circumstances change in ways that invalidate initial assumptions. Rather than treating this uncertainty as a problem to eliminate through better planning, Pre-Commit frames commitment as making informed bets where the goal involves maximizing learning regardless of outcome.

The phase integrates ABDUCTIO—a framework for decision-making under uncertainty that tracks both credence (belief strength) and confidence (belief stability). This integration provides epistemic rigor that most coaching frameworks lack, forcing explicit reasoning about whether practitioners actually believe a promise is worth making and how stable that belief would be under scrutiny. The ABDUCTIO process also serves a dual function of creating cognitive saturation that prepares consciousness for the installation work that follows in the Commit Phase.

Pre-Commit culminates in promise architecture that specifies commitment details with precision sufficient for verification while maintaining flexibility appropriate to the domain. The well-formed promise includes explicit action specifications, timeline boundaries, success criteria, domain mapping, and coherence with existing commitments and values. This architecture provides the foundation that installation and execution require.

## Introduction: The Gatekeeping Function

The Pre-Commit Phase serves as the essential gate that determines what enters the promise cycle. Without rigorous pre-commit assessment, practitioners make commitments based on enthusiasm, social pressure, or fleeting motivation that cannot sustain the installation and execution work required for promise-keeping. The resulting failures damage confidence and discourage further development rather than building agency.

Most personal development approaches treat commitment decisions as relatively straightforward. Practitioners identify desires or areas for improvement, translate these into goals, and proceed to execution planning. This simplistic approach ignores the complex factors that determine whether particular commitments will serve development or undermine it. It assumes that if something seems desirable, committing to it is appropriate, when in reality most desirable outcomes require commitments that current capacity cannot sustain.

The Pre-Commit Phase introduces systematic evaluation that examines multiple dimensions before commitment occurs. Practitioners assess whether intentions arise from authentic motivation versus external pressure or distorted self-image. They evaluate whether current capacity can realistically support the proposed commitment. They examine whether the promise conflicts with existing commitments or values in ways that would create internal sabotage. They structure the commitment with sufficient specificity for verification while maintaining appropriate flexibility.

This multi-dimensional assessment requires time and cognitive effort that many practitioners initially resist. The impulse to "just commit and do it" feels more action-oriented than systematic pre-commit work. However, this impulse typically produces promises that fail predictably, generating discouragement that undermines agency development more severely than the delay pre-commit assessment introduces. Time invested in thorough triage pays dividends through higher promise-keeping rates and avoided failures.

The Pre-Commit Phase also recognizes that not every intention warrants formalization into promise. Some desires appropriately remain aspirations without commitment. Some possibilities deserve exploration without binding promise. The phase helps practitioners distinguish between intentions worth committing to versus those better held lightly or pursued through different mechanisms. This discrimination prevents promise proliferation that would overwhelm capacity and dilute the power of commitments that receive formal promise architecture.

## The Sensemaking Challenge

Human decision-making operates in environments characterized by complexity, ambiguity, and genuine uncertainty. The Pre-Commit Phase must address these realities rather than pretending that sufficient analysis can eliminate uncertainty or that commitment decisions involve straightforward calculation.

### Operating Under Uncertainty

Every commitment represents a bet made with incomplete information. A practitioner considering whether to promise daily meditation cannot know with certainty whether this practice will produce the anticipated benefits for their particular psychology and circumstances. They may discover that meditation activates anxiety rather than reducing it, that their schedule proves incompatible with consistent practice, or that the benefits materialize differently than expected.

Traditional planning approaches attempt to reduce uncertainty through more thorough analysis, extended research, or detailed contingency planning. While these activities have value, they cannot eliminate the fundamental uncertainty that characterizes human existence. At some point, practitioners must commit despite incomplete knowledge, making informed bets rather than waiting for certainty that will never arrive.

The Pre-Commit Phase embraces this reality by treating commitment as hypothesis formation rather than certain prediction. The practitioner hypothesizes that making and keeping a particular promise will enhance their agency more than alternative uses of capacity. This hypothesis will be tested through execution and evaluated through post-commit learning extraction. The goal involves making increasingly well-calibrated bets over time rather than eliminating the betting process entirely.

This framing reduces the psychological burden of commitment decisions. Practitioners need not convince themselves that success is guaranteed or that they possess perfect information. They need only assess that the bet is sufficiently promising given available information and that the learning from execution will be valuable regardless of whether the promise is kept. This permission to commit despite uncertainty prevents the analysis paralysis that can emerge when practitioners believe they should only commit when certain of success.

### The Intention Landscape

At any given moment, practitioners face numerous possible commitments across multiple life domains. Professional development opportunities, relationship deepening possibilities, health practice options, creative project ideas, community contribution invitations, and personal growth directions all present themselves as potentially valuable. The sheer abundance of possibilities creates decision paralysis where choosing any particular commitment feels like abandoning numerous others.

The Pre-Commit Phase provides structure for navigating this abundance through explicit triage that prioritizes based on clear criteria rather than allowing unconscious patterns or external pressure to determine what receives commitment. The framework establishes several filtering questions that help practitioners distinguish high-priority from low-priority possibilities.

Alignment with core values and identity represents the first filter. Commitments that connect to what the practitioner genuinely cares about sustain motivation through difficulty better than those pursued for external reasons. A practitioner who values creative expression may find promises about artistic practice more sustainable than promises about professional advancement pursued primarily for social status or financial security. The triage process examines whether proposed promises connect to authentic motivation or reflect "should" thinking based on external expectations.

Current capacity and resource availability provide another essential filter. A promise that would serve important values but exceeds available capacity sets the practitioner up for failure that undermines rather than builds agency. The triage assesses whether the practitioner currently possesses the time, energy, skill, and support necessary for realistic promise-keeping. Aspirational commitments that assume dramatic capacity expansion rarely succeed and typically produce discouragement when the hoped-for transformation doesn't materialize.

Strategic positioning within the practitioner's broader development trajectory offers a third filter. Some commitments represent natural next steps building on existing capability while others would require substantial foundation not yet in place. Triage examines whether the proposed promise fits the practitioner's current developmental edge versus representing a leap beyond realistic progression. Promises that stretch current capacity appropriately drive growth, while those far beyond current capability typically fail and damage confidence.

The relationship to existing commitments and life circumstances provides a fourth filter. Promises that would conflict with existing commitments or that ignore current life realities (caregiving responsibilities, health challenges, work demands, relationship circumstances) rarely survive contact with actual execution conditions. The triage examines how proposed promises would interact with the rest of the practitioner's life rather than treating each commitment in isolation.

### The Role of Intuition and Analysis

Pre-Commit work integrates both intuitive sensing and explicit analysis, recognizing that each contributes essential information that the other cannot provide. Pure intuition without analytical validation may reflect wishful thinking, social pressure, or unconscious patterns rather than genuine assessment of what would serve agency development. Pure analysis without intuitive confirmation may produce commitments that look reasonable on paper but lack the emotional resonance necessary for sustained motivation.

The triage process typically begins with intuitive sensing. When an intention surfaces, the practitioner notices their felt response. Does the possibility create genuine excitement and forward pull? Does it produce obligation and heaviness? Does it generate ambivalence with simultaneous attraction and resistance? This intuitive data provides important information about whether the commitment aligns with authentic motivation versus reflecting external pressure or distorted self-image.

However, intuition alone proves insufficient because the same physiological activation can indicate either genuine excitement or anxiety, and the unconscious system sometimes resists changes that would actually serve growth while enthusiastically supporting patterns that provide short-term comfort at long-term cost. The analytical phase examines the intuitive response through explicit reasoning about capacity, alignment, strategic fit, and interaction with existing commitments.

The integration occurs when analysis either validates or challenges intuitive responses. Strong intuitive pull combined with analytical confirmation suggests a high-quality commitment candidate. Strong intuitive pull that analysis reveals as unrealistic capacity assessment requires reconciliation—either adjusting the promise to match capacity or recognizing that the intuition reflects wishful thinking rather than genuine assessment. Weak intuitive response despite analytical support may indicate that the commitment serves instrumental goals without connecting to deeper motivation, suggesting either reframing to access the authentic desire or recognizing that this particular commitment isn't currently compelling enough to warrant promise.

## The ABDUCTIO Integration

The Pre-Commit Phase integrates ABDUCTIO as a formal tool for evaluating commitment candidates under uncertainty. This integration provides epistemic rigor while also serving the dual function of creating cognitive saturation that prepares for installation work.

### Credence and Confidence Assessment

ABDUCTIO introduces two distinct metrics for evaluating beliefs about proposed commitments. Credence (p) represents the practitioner's best estimate of the probability that making and keeping this promise will produce the desired outcomes. Confidence (k) represents the stability of that belief—how much the credence would change under reasonable scrutiny or additional information.

This two-number system surfaces a critical distinction that single-metric approaches miss. A practitioner might have high credence that a promise will work (p = 0.85) but low confidence in that assessment (k = 0.3) because it rests on untested assumptions. This combination signals the "high-credence trap" where apparent certainty masks hidden fragility. Conversely, a practitioner might have moderate credence (p = 0.6) with high confidence (k = 0.8) based on extensive evidence and testing, representing a more solid foundation despite lower apparent certainty.

The credence assessment requires the practitioner to articulate a specific probability estimate rather than vague statements about possibility or likelihood. This precision forces explicit reasoning about what factors support the belief and what would constitute evidence of success. The practitioner cannot hide behind ambiguous language like "this should work" but must specify an actual probability estimate that can be evaluated and calibrated over time.

The confidence assessment examines the basis for the credence judgment. High confidence indicates that the belief rests on tested assumptions, relevant experience, and factors the practitioner understands well. Low confidence indicates that belief rests on untested assumptions, speculation about factors outside the practitioner's experience, or areas where surprises could easily occur. This metacognitive awareness about belief stability prevents overconfidence that leads to poor commitment decisions.

### The 2x2 Matrix and Triage Decisions

ABDUCTIO organizes commitment candidates into a 2x2 matrix based on credence and confidence levels, with each quadrant suggesting different actions.

High credence with high confidence represents "The Solid Bet"—commitments that the practitioner has good reason to believe will work and where that belief rests on solid foundation. These candidates warrant proceeding to promise architecture and installation. The combination of strong belief and stable foundation suggests the commitment has passed rigorous triage.

High credence with low confidence represents "The High-Credence Trap"—commitments that appear promising but rest on untested assumptions or hidden fragility. These candidates require investigation before commitment. The practitioner should identify what assumptions underlie the high credence and test those assumptions through research, consultation, or small experiments before making full promise commitment. Proceeding directly to installation with untested assumptions frequently produces failures that could have been avoided through preliminary investigation.

Low credence with high confidence represents "The Obvious No"—commitments that the practitioner has good reason to believe would not work. These candidates should be rejected without extensive deliberation. The stable low assessment indicates the commitment doesn't warrant further investment of triage resources.

Low credence with low confidence represents "The Plausible Longshot"—commitments where the practitioner is genuinely uncertain whether they would work. These candidates warrant investigation similar to high-credence trap cases, but with recognition that even investigation may not resolve the uncertainty. The practitioner must decide whether the potential value justifies committing despite uncertainty or whether this remains too speculative for promise-level commitment.

### Decomposition and Bottleneck Identification

When ABDUCTIO assessment reveals low confidence in a proposed commitment, the framework provides structured decomposition that breaks down the overall promise into constituent assumptions and preconditions. This decomposition surfaces which specific elements create the confidence gap, allowing targeted investigation rather than general anxiety about whether the commitment will work.

The decomposition process asks: "For this promise to succeed, what must be true?" This question generates a list of necessary conditions that can each be evaluated separately. A promise about starting a daily writing practice might decompose into preconditions about having adequate time available, possessing sufficient writing skill to avoid frustration, having workspace conducive to focused work, and experiencing writing as meaningful rather than obligatory.

Each precondition receives its own credence and confidence assessment. Often the decomposition reveals that overall low confidence derives from one or two specific preconditions where uncertainty is concentrated. These bottleneck factors become the focus for investigation. If the practitioner has low confidence about whether they'll experience writing as meaningful, they might experiment with writing practices before making a full promise commitment, testing whether the activity produces the expected satisfaction.

The decomposition also surfaces when proposed promises actually represent multiple distinct commitments bundled together. A promise about "getting healthy" might decompose into separate commitments about nutrition, exercise, sleep, and stress management. Attempting to install this bundle as a single promise typically produces confusion and failure. The decomposition allows the practitioner to recognize that multiple distinct promises are needed or that the commitment should be narrowed to a single focus area initially.

### The Dual Function: Analysis and Consciousness Preparation

The ABDUCTIO process serves not only as commitment evaluation but also as preparation for the installation work that follows in Commit Phase. The structured thinking, decomposition, and bottleneck identification create a particular form of cognitive engagement that produces receptivity for installation.

When practitioners work through ABDUCTIO assessment, they engage explicit analytical processing intensively. The decomposition of assumptions, probability estimation, and confidence evaluation activate conscious reasoning systems fully. This activation followed by installation work creates a natural transition from effortful conscious processing to the receptive states where unconscious installation can occur.

The framework recognizes that the boundary between "analysis paralysis" and "productive cognitive saturation" involves subtle distinction. Analysis becomes paralytic when it substitutes for action without producing useful information or when it circles through the same territory repeatedly without progression. The ABDUCTIO stop conditions prevent this by establishing clear criteria for when further analysis is valuable versus when commitment decisions should proceed despite remaining uncertainty.

However, the extensive thinking that ABDUCTIO requires before reaching stop conditions creates exactly the cognitive state that makes installation work effective. The conscious mind becomes saturated with detail and complexity, making the shift into receptive installation states more accessible. The practitioner has engaged their analytical capacity fully and is ready to transition into different modes of processing.

## Promise Architecture

Once triage assessment confirms that an intention warrants promise commitment, the Pre-Commit Phase moves to structuring that commitment with precision sufficient for installation and verification. This promise architecture work transforms vague intentions into specifications clear enough for the Commit Phase to install and the Post-Commit Phase to evaluate.

### Action Specification

The promise must specify what action the practitioner commits to with sufficient precision that both they and any external observers could determine whether the action occurred. Vague commitments like "exercise more" or "be more productive" cannot be verified and provide insufficient specification for installation. The architecture requires explicit action description.

Action specification should balance precision with flexibility appropriate to the domain. A promise in domains requiring strict behavioral consistency might specify "complete 30 minutes of cardiovascular exercise" with clear definition of what counts as cardiovascular exercise. A promise in creative domains might specify "engage in writing practice for 45 minutes" without requiring particular output quality, recognizing that creative process benefits from permission to produce poorly.

The specification must also clarify frequency and timing. Does the action occur daily, weekly, or according to some other schedule? Are there specific times or contexts when the action should occur? A promise to "write regularly" leaves frequency ambiguous in ways that undermine both installation and evaluation. "Write for 45 minutes, five mornings per week" provides clarity that supports implementation.

Action specification should distinguish between controllable behaviors and desired outcomes. The practitioner can control whether they engage in writing practice but cannot control whether good writing emerges from that practice. Promises should focus on controllable actions rather than outcomes dependent on factors outside the practitioner's control. This distinction prevents the demoralization that occurs when practitioners keep their behavioral commitments but the desired outcomes don't materialize due to circumstances beyond their influence.

### Timeline Boundaries

Promises require temporal boundaries that define when the commitment begins, how long it continues, and what conditions would constitute completion. Open-ended commitments without temporal structure rarely produce the focused effort necessary for sustained promise-keeping and cannot be evaluated definitively.

The start date should be explicit and near-term. Promises that begin "sometime in the future" lack the concrete activation that installation requires. The practitioner should specify exactly when promise execution begins—typically within days of installation rather than weeks or months forward. This near-term activation allows installation work to create patterns that activate promptly rather than remaining dormant for extended periods.

The duration or endpoint requires similar specification. Some promises have natural completion points tied to specific goals—"complete the draft of my book proposal by March 15th." Others represent ongoing practices that might be time-bounded for assessment purposes—"maintain daily meditation practice for eight weeks, then evaluate." The temporal boundary creates a defined commitment period that can be evaluated and learned from, after which the practitioner decides whether to recommit, modify, or conclude the promise.

The framework distinguishes between promises that appropriately remain open-ended and those that benefit from defined duration. Foundational practices like sleep hygiene or relationship maintenance might warrant open-ended commitment with periodic review rather than fixed endpoints. Experimental practices being tested for fit or intensive development periods pursuing specific capabilities often benefit from defined duration that creates commitment without demanding permanent behavior change before effectiveness is established.

### Success Criteria and Verification

The promise architecture must specify what constitutes successful fulfillment with sufficient clarity that verification can occur. This specification serves multiple functions including enabling post-commit evaluation of promise-keeping, allowing installation of clear targets rather than ambiguous aspirations, and creating accountability through observable commitment.

Success criteria should be as objective as the domain allows. Behavioral promises can often specify objective verification through observable actions or documentation. "Complete three 30-minute cardio sessions per week" can be verified through calendar logs, fitness tracker data, or third-party observation. Creative promises may require more subjective assessment but should still specify what constitutes fulfillment—"engage in writing practice for 45 minutes five times per week" can be verified through time logs even if output quality remains subjective.

The criteria must also address what constitutes meaningful execution versus technical compliance that violates promise spirit. A practitioner could technically keep a promise about writing practice by opening a document for 45 minutes while actually browsing social media. The architecture should specify engagement quality where appropriate—"focused writing practice without distraction" versus merely "time at keyboard."

The framework includes provisions for promises that allow flexibility in execution while maintaining commitment integrity. Rather than requiring perfect daily adherence, promises might specify weekly totals that allow daily variation. Rather than demanding specific performance levels, promises might require showing up for practice regardless of how the body or mind performs on particular days. This flexibility prevents the rigid perfectionism that causes practitioners to abandon commitments after single lapses.

Verification mechanisms should be specified during architecture phase. Will the practitioner self-report through logs or journals? Will objective data from devices or platforms provide verification? Will third-party observation or attestation be involved? The Promise Protocol introduced in Post-Commit establishes formal verification standards, but the architecture phase should clarify what verification approach will be employed.

### Domain Mapping

Every promise maps to one or more domains within the hierarchical domain system that structures the Agency Protocol. This mapping serves multiple functions including providing context for what the promise entails, connecting the promise to established standards for performance in particular areas, enabling merit tracking and capability assessment, and facilitating coordination with other practitioners working in similar domains.

Domain mapping requires understanding the domain taxonomy and selecting mappings that accurately represent the promise's nature. A promise about daily exercise might map to `/health/fitness/_adheresToExerciseFrequency` with parameters specifying the frequency and duration. A promise about relationship communication might map to `/relationships/partnership/_initiatesWeeklyCheckIns`.

The mapping should be specific enough to provide meaningful context without becoming overly granular. If the domain system includes highly detailed sub-classifications, the practitioner should map to the level that provides useful structure without excessive administrative overhead. The test involves whether the domain mapping helps clarify what the promise entails and enables meaningful capability tracking.

Some promises may warrant multiple domain mappings when they span different life areas or serve multiple functions. A promise about weekly family dinners might map to both relationship domains and health/nutrition domains if the practice serves both connection and eating pattern goals. However, extensive multiple mapping should prompt examination of whether a single promise attempts to accomplish too much and would benefit from decomposition into separate commitments.

### Coherence Checks

Before promise architecture is finalized, the Pre-Commit Phase includes explicit checks for coherence with existing commitments, values, and circumstances. These checks surface conflicts that would undermine promise-keeping before installation occurs.

#### Internal Coherence

Internal coherence examination asks whether different aspects of the practitioner's personality and value system align behind the proposed promise or whether internal conflicts exist that would sabotage execution. This examination often reveals that what initially appeared as unified intention actually masks significant ambivalence or internal disagreement.

The coherence check involves imagining keeping the promise successfully and noticing whether any internal resistance surfaces. Does a part of the personality feel concerned or opposed? If resistance emerges, the check explores what that part values or fears. Often resistant parts hold important concerns that deserve consideration rather than dismissal.

For example, a practitioner considering a promise about assertiveness might discover internal resistance from a part that values harmony and fears conflict. Rather than dismissing this resistance as weakness to overcome, the coherence check facilitates dialogue between the part wanting assertiveness and the part valuing harmony. Perhaps integration emerges where assertiveness is reframed as serving harmony through honest communication rather than opposing it.

When internal conflicts cannot be resolved through reframing or parts integration, the coherence check may reveal that the proposed promise is premature. Perhaps foundational work addressing the underlying fears or values conflict must occur before behavioral commitment makes sense. Attempting to install promises over unresolved internal conflicts typically produces failures that reinforce the conflicted state rather than resolving it.

#### External Coherence  

External coherence examination assesses whether the proposed promise conflicts with existing commitments, life circumstances, or relationship obligations. Promises that ignore these external realities rarely survive contact with actual execution conditions.

The check examines whether the time, energy, and attention the promise requires actually exist given current obligations. A parent of young children committing to daily extended creative sessions may discover that the promise ignores childcare realities. A practitioner in demanding job transition committing to extensive new health practices may discover insufficient margin for the proposed changes.

Relationship coherence deserves particular attention. Does the proposed promise require cooperation or accommodation from others who have not agreed to provide it? Does it create impacts on partners, family, or housemates who should be consulted before commitment occurs? Promises that unilaterally impose costs on others without their consent often encounter resistance that practitioners experience as personal failure when it actually reflects reasonable pushback from affected parties.

The coherence check also examines whether the proposed promise conflicts with existing promises in ways that create zero-sum competition for resources. If the practitioner already maintains commitments consuming 80% of available capacity, adding another significant promise may produce portfolio collapse where no promises receive adequate attention.

When external conflicts surface, several responses are possible. The promise might be modified to fit within actual constraints. Existing commitments might be renegotiated to create space for the new promise. The decision might be that this promise should wait until circumstances change. The key involves making these adjustments during Pre-Commit rather than discovering conflicts during execution.

## Pre-Commit Protocols and Tools

The Pre-Commit Phase employs structured protocols and tools that guide practitioners through the triage and architecture process systematically. These supports prevent common failure modes and ensure that necessary assessments occur.

### The Desire Surfacing Protocol

The Pre-Commit process begins with explicit examination of where the intention to make a promise originates and what motivates commitment. This desire surfacing work distinguishes authentic motivation from various forms of distorted or externally-imposed "shoulds" that undermine sustainable commitment.

The protocol asks several questions designed to surface the quality of motivation. When did this intention first emerge and what circumstances surrounded its appearance? Does the desire feel internally generated or does it respond to external pressure or comparison? What would be different if this promise were kept successfully—what changes in experience, identity, or circumstances does the practitioner anticipate? If the promise were kept but no one else knew about it, would it still feel meaningful?

These questions help identify common motivation distortions. Some intentions arise primarily from shame or self-judgment rather than genuine desire for change—the practitioner "should" exercise not because they value movement but because they judge their current body as inadequate. Some intentions reflect social comparison or status seeking rather than authentic values—the practitioner wants to complete a marathon not because running is meaningful but because it would provide impressive social media content.

The protocol also examines whether the intention carries quality of "moving toward" desired states versus "running from" feared or disliked current conditions. Both can motivate change, but "running from" motivation often becomes weaker once the acute discomfort diminishes, while "moving toward" motivation tends to sustain better across varying circumstances. Understanding the motivation quality helps practitioners assess sustainability and calibrate promises appropriately.

The desire surfacing sometimes reveals that what appeared as single intention actually represents multiple distinct desires bundled together. A practitioner wanting to "get in shape" might discover separate desires for physical capability, aesthetic appearance, health outcomes, and social belonging through fitness community. These distinct desires may warrant different promises or may need explicit acknowledgment about which is primary versus secondary.

### The Capacity Assessment Protocol

Accurate capacity assessment represents one of the most critical and most commonly failed aspects of Pre-Commit work. Practitioners routinely overestimate their available capacity and underestimate what promises actually require, producing commitment failures that were predictable given realistic assessment.

The capacity protocol examines multiple dimensions of resource availability. Time capacity assessment involves not just counting hours but honestly evaluating discretionary time after accounting for non-negotiable obligations, transition time between activities, and necessary margin for unexpected demands. The practitioner should track actual time use for at least several days to ground assessment in reality rather than wishful thinking about how time "should" be used.

Energy capacity assessment recognizes that available time does not automatically translate to capacity for promise execution. A practitioner might have an hour available at 9pm but lack the mental or physical energy for focused creative work or vigorous exercise. The protocol asks about typical energy patterns across days and weeks, identifying when capacity for different types of activities is actually available.

The assessment also examines competing demands and their priority relative to the proposed promise. What currently fills the time and energy that this promise would require? Would those activities simply be eliminated or would they create ongoing pull that would undermine the new promise? If a practitioner commits to daily morning meditation while currently using morning time for email checking, the email habit will likely create interference unless explicitly addressed.

Skill and knowledge requirements deserve assessment when promises depend on capabilities the practitioner may not yet possess. A promise to write daily may founder if the practitioner lacks basic writing fluency or if they don't know how to structure practice sessions productively. The assessment asks whether foundational capabilities exist or whether capability development must occur before or alongside promise execution.

Social and environmental support availability requires examination when promises depend on cooperation or resources from others. Does the practitioner have access to necessary spaces, equipment, or information? Do key relationships support the commitment or create friction? A promise about dietary change may prove difficult if household members resist or if work environment provides limited food options.

The capacity protocol includes explicit calibration against past performance. How have similar commitments fared previously? If the practitioner has repeatedly failed promises requiring daily discipline, a new daily promise warrants skepticism about whether capacity has actually changed. Past performance provides valuable data about actual capacity versus aspirational estimates.

### The Interaction Effect Analysis

Promises do not exist in isolation but interact with existing commitments, habits, and life patterns. The Pre-Commit Phase includes structured examination of how the proposed promise would affect and be affected by these existing elements.

The analysis begins by mapping current active promises and significant habitual commitments. This mapping creates visibility into the ecosystem that the new promise would enter. The practitioner identifies what promises are currently active, what habitual patterns consume significant time or energy, what relationship obligations create regular demands, and what environmental or circumstantial factors shape daily experience.

The analysis then examines potential interactions between the proposed promise and each existing element. Would keeping the new promise make existing promises easier or harder? Would it reinforce helpful habits or compete with them? Would it create relationship tension or enhance connection? Would environmental factors support or hinder the new commitment?

Synergistic relationships deserve identification and emphasis. If a promise about morning exercise would naturally improve sleep patterns that support an existing promise about focused work, this synergy strengthens the case for commitment. The practitioner might intentionally design the promise to maximize synergistic effects with existing patterns.

Antagonistic relationships require careful consideration. If a promise about extended creative sessions would consume time currently used for relationship maintenance, this conflict must be addressed. Either the promise should be modified to accommodate relationship needs, relationship time should be restructured, or the decision might be that this promise should wait until relationship dynamics can support it.

The analysis should be particularly attentive to resource competition where multiple commitments draw on the same limited pools of time, energy, or willpower. If three existing promises already consume morning time and energy, adding a fourth morning commitment may produce portfolio collapse rather than incremental addition.

### The Futures Walkthrough Protocol

The Pre-Commit Phase includes structured imagination of promise execution under realistic conditions. This walkthrough surfaces practical challenges and execution barriers that abstract reasoning might miss.

The protocol guides the practitioner through detailed visualization of keeping the promise on a typical day. What specifically happens? When does the promised action occur? What does the practitioner do immediately before and after? What environmental conditions exist? What internal state does the practitioner experience? This detailed walkthrough often reveals practical barriers—the meditation cushion is in a closet requiring retrieval, the gym is 20 minutes away making "quick" workouts impractical, the writing software takes minutes to load reducing available practice time.

The walkthrough should include variation across different conditions. How would the promise be kept on a high-energy day versus a depleted day? How would it work on weekdays versus weekends? What would happen during travel or schedule disruption? This variation testing surfaces whether promise architecture has sufficient flexibility to accommodate realistic circumstance variation or whether it assumes unrealistic consistency.

The protocol also walks through promise failure scenarios. What would cause the practitioner to break this promise? When would they be most vulnerable to lapse? What resistance would emerge? This failure imagination serves two functions: it identifies risks that should be addressed during installation, and it surfaces whether the practitioner actually believes keeping the promise is realistic given anticipated challenges.

The walkthrough includes examining the promise from the perspective of successful completion. Imagine the promise has been kept successfully for its full duration. What changed? What was different than expected? What was harder or easier? This completion imagination helps assess whether the anticipated outcomes are compelling enough to sustain commitment through difficulty and whether the practitioner genuinely believes the promise is achievable.

## The Pre-Commit Decision Point

After working through assessment protocols and promise architecture, the Pre-Commit Phase reaches an explicit decision point about whether to proceed to installation. This decision should be deliberate rather than automatic, with clear criteria for when commitment is appropriate.

### Readiness Criteria

Several factors indicate readiness to proceed from Pre-Commit to Commit Phase. The promise specification should be precise enough that both practitioner and potential observers could verify whether it's being kept. Ambiguity in action specification, timeline, or success criteria indicates architecture work is incomplete.

ABDUCTIO assessment should show credence and confidence levels appropriate to the commitment being considered. For promises involving significant resource investment or identity implications, both credence and confidence should be relatively high (typically above 0.7 on both dimensions). For experimental promises being tested at low cost, moderate levels may suffice.

Internal coherence should be established with no significant unresolved conflicts between different parts of the personality. If ambivalence or resistance remains, this signals that parts integration work is needed before installation should occur. Attempting to install over unresolved internal conflicts typically produces promise failure.

External coherence should be verified with the promise fitting within available capacity and compatible with existing commitments and circumstances. If significant resource conflicts or practical barriers remain, the promise architecture should be modified or the decision might be that this commitment should wait until circumstances change.

The practitioner should report genuine desire to make this commitment rather than obligation or "should" thinking. The promise should feel compelling and meaningful rather than imposed. While some anxiety about ability to keep the promise is normal and even helpful, the predominant feeling should be desire to commit rather than dread or reluctance.

### Red Flags Requiring Additional Work

Certain signs indicate that Pre-Commit work is incomplete and proceeding to installation would be premature. Continued ambiguity about what the promise actually entails suggests specification needs refinement. If the practitioner cannot articulate clearly and specifically what they're committing to, installation will lack the precision it requires.

Persistent questions about whether this is the "right" promise to make signal uncertainty that should be resolved before commitment. While some uncertainty is inevitable, sustained questioning suggests the intention hasn't stabilized sufficiently for formalization into promise.

Inability to imagine keeping the promise successfully or getting "stuck" during futures walkthrough indicates that the practitioner lacks confidence the commitment is achievable. This may reflect poor capacity assessment or may reveal that the promise exceeds realistic capability given current circumstances. Additional investigation or promise scope reduction may be needed.

Discovery of significant resource conflicts or external barriers during later assessment stages requires addressing those issues before proceeding. Finding that the promise would require time currently committed elsewhere or would create relationship tension suggests either promise modification or circumstance changes are needed first.

Lack of compelling motivation or presence of primarily "should" thinking indicates that desire surfacing is incomplete. Attempting to install promises driven by external pressure or self-judgment typically fails because the authentic motivation necessary to sustain commitment through difficulty doesn't exist.

### The Commitment Affirmation

When readiness criteria are met and no red flags remain, the Pre-Commit Phase concludes with explicit commitment affirmation. The practitioner states clearly and definitively: "Yes, I will make and carry this promise." This affirmation represents the transition point from consideration to commitment.

The affirmation should be spoken aloud rather than merely thought, activating additional commitment mechanisms through verbal declaration. The practitioner should affirm the complete promise specification including action, timeline, success criteria, and domain mapping. This full articulation ensures clarity and activates the neural patterns that installation will build upon.

The affirmation moment also serves as final check. As the practitioner states the commitment definitively, they should notice their felt response. Does the affirmation feel solid and congruent? Or does hesitation or resistance surface? If the latter occurs even after all assessment protocols, this signals that something remains unresolved and installation should not proceed.

When affirmation feels solid, the Pre-Commit Phase is complete and the practitioner is ready for the installation work that follows in Commit Phase. The thorough foundation established through triage and architecture increases dramatically the probability that installation will be successful and that promise execution will generate learning and capability development regardless of whether the promise is ultimately kept.

## Common Pre-Commit Failures

Understanding common failure patterns in Pre-Commit work helps practitioners and coaches recognize and avoid these pitfalls.

### Rushing to Commitment

The most frequent Pre-Commit failure involves insufficient time spent in assessment and architecture before proceeding to installation. Practitioners feel impatient with the deliberate pace of thorough triage and want to "just commit and start." This rushing typically reflects enthusiasm or anxiety rather than genuine readiness.

The impulse to rush often indicates that the practitioner expects commitment itself to resolve uncertainty or create motivation that doesn't yet exist. They hope that formalizing the promise will somehow make unclear things clear or make desired changes feel more compelling. However, commitment does not create the foundation it requires—it only succeeds when adequate foundation already exists.

Coaches can address rushing by explaining that time invested in Pre-Commit reduces overall time to success by preventing predictable failures. A thorough Pre-Commit process taking several days or even weeks generates higher promise-keeping rates than rushed commitments that save days but fail after weeks of installation and execution effort. The time accounting should include prevented failures, not just time to initial commitment.

The framework establishes minimum duration for Pre-Commit work as a circuit breaker against rushing. Practitioners should spend at minimum several days between intention emergence and commitment affirmation, allowing assessment protocols to occur with adequate deliberation. For significant promises involving substantial resource commitment or identity implications, minimum duration might extend to one or two weeks.

### Overestimating Capacity

Capacity overestimation represents another pervasive failure pattern where practitioners convince themselves they can sustain commitment levels that objective assessment would reveal as unrealistic. This overestimation often reflects motivated reasoning where the practitioner's desire for change distorts capacity evaluation.

The overestimation manifests in several ways. Practitioners calculate available time based on theoretical maximums rather than realistic averages that account for variation and unexpected demands. They assume their future selves will have more discipline or energy than their current selves actually possess. They minimize competing demands or assume those demands will somehow resolve themselves once commitment is made.

The capacity protocol attempts to surface this overestimation through explicit past performance calibration and detailed walkthrough of realistic execution conditions. However, practitioners skilled at self-deception can rationalize away evidence that challenges their preferred commitment levels. External perspective through coaching or peer review often proves necessary to reality-test capacity claims.

The framework addresses overestimation by encouraging conservative initial commitments that can be expanded based on demonstrated capacity rather than ambitious commitments that require hoped-for capacity expansion. Better to keep a modest promise and increase complexity than to break an overambitious promise and damage confidence. The merit-based progression system creates structure for this conservative-to-ambitious trajectory.

### Ignoring Internal Conflicts

Practitioners frequently proceed to commitment despite unresolved ambivalence or internal conflicts, hoping that installation or willpower will overcome resistance. This hope rarely materializes—unresolved conflicts typically sabotage execution regardless of installation quality.

The internal conflict most commonly involves tensions between different values or between different parts of the personality with incompatible agendas. A practitioner might consciously want to establish boundaries while unconsciously fearing that boundaries will damage relationships. These conflicts remain hidden if coherence checks are superficial or if practitioners dismiss resistance as weakness rather than treating it as meaningful communication.

The framework addresses internal conflicts through explicit parts work during coherence checking. When resistance surfaces, the protocol facilitates dialogue rather than dismissal. Often this dialogue reveals that resistant parts hold legitimate concerns that deserve addressing. Integration occurs when all parts agree the promise serves their underlying values better than current patterns, not through conscious override of unconscious resistance.

When internal conflicts cannot be resolved during Pre-Commit, the appropriate response involves recognizing that this commitment is premature. Perhaps foundational therapeutic work addressing the underlying conflicts must occur before behavioral promise makes sense. Attempting to install over unresolved conflicts wastes resources and produces failures that reinforce the conflicted state.

### Insufficient Specificity

Many practitioners complete Pre-Commit work with promise specifications that feel clear to them but lack the precision necessary for installation and verification. The gap between felt clarity and actual specification becomes apparent only when installation attempts reveal ambiguity or when execution raises questions about whether the promise is being kept.

Insufficient specificity often reflects discomfort with the commitment that precise specification would create. Vague promises allow unconscious escape routes where the practitioner can claim they're keeping the commitment while actually avoiding the challenging elements. "Exercise regularly" feels less binding than "complete three 30-minute cardio sessions per week," allowing interpretation that protects against failure at the cost of meaningful commitment.

The promise architecture protocols address specification through explicit requirements for action clarity, timeline boundaries, success criteria, and verification mechanisms. However, practitioners can comply superficially with these requirements while maintaining essential ambiguity. "Write daily" specifies frequency but leaves duration, quality standards, and what counts as writing undefined in ways that undermine execution.

Coaches should test specifications by imagining verification scenarios. Could an external observer determine whether this promise was kept? Would the practitioner themselves know definitively? If ambiguity remains, the specification needs refinement. The discomfort that precise specification creates often signals important information about whether genuine commitment exists.

## Coach and Practitioner Roles

The Pre-Commit Phase involves distinct responsibilities for coaches facilitating the process and practitioners doing the commitment work.

### Coach Responsibilities

Coaches guide practitioners through Pre-Commit protocols while maintaining appropriate boundaries between facilitation and decision-making. The coach's role involves asking questions that surface important considerations, providing external perspective on capacity and coherence assessment, teaching and facilitating ABDUCTIO and other assessment tools, challenging rationalizations and motivated reasoning, and holding space for ambivalence and uncertainty rather than rushing to resolution.

The coach should not make commitment decisions for practitioners or pressure practitioners toward particular promises. The coach facilitates assessment but the practitioner determines whether commitment is appropriate. This boundary preserves practitioner agency while providing the guidance and external perspective that improve commitment quality.

Effective coaching in Pre-Commit requires tolerance for practitioner uncertainty and resistance to moving quickly toward commitment. Less experienced coaches often feel pressure to produce commitment decisions within sessions, treating extended assessment as somehow failing to make progress. Experienced coaches recognize that thorough assessment preventing poor commitments represents valuable progress even when it doesn't yield rapid commitment decisions.

The coach should explicitly address the economics of Pre-Commit time investment. Practitioners paying for coaching may feel pressure to "get their money's worth" through making commitments rather than spending time in assessment. The coach should frame thorough Pre-Commit as exactly what creates value through prevented failures and higher success rates. The investment pays returns through promise-keeping rather than through volume of promises made.

### Practitioner Responsibilities

Practitioners engaging Pre-Commit work must commit to honest self-assessment even when that honesty reveals uncomfortable truths about capacity, motivation, or current circumstances. The quality of Pre-Commit work depends entirely on whether practitioners bring genuine candor to the assessment process versus performing assessment while protecting preferred conclusions.

The practitioner should engage assessment protocols with genuine curiosity about what they discover rather than using protocols to validate predetermined commitment decisions. ABDUCTIO assessment loses its value if the practitioner simply assigns probability numbers that justify desired conclusions rather than genuinely examining what they believe and how stable those beliefs are.

Practitioners should also recognize that Pre-Commit may reveal that particular intentions should not become promises. This outcome represents success rather than failure—the process prevented a poor commitment that would have consumed resources and generated discouragement. The practitioner serves their agency development by declining to promise when assessment reveals inadequate foundation.

The practitioner must also take responsibility for communicating honestly with coaches about their internal experience during assessment. If ambivalence surfaces, if capacity concerns arise, if external conflicts emerge, the practitioner should voice these rather than concealing them to avoid disappointing the coach or to maintain momentum toward commitment. The coach cannot facilitate effectively without accurate information about the practitioner's internal state and circumstances.

## Integration with Commit and Post-Commit Phases

Pre-Commit establishes foundation that subsequent phases build upon. The quality of this foundation determines whether Commit Phase installation and Post-Commit execution can succeed.

### Handoff to Commit Phase

When Pre-Commit concludes successfully with commitment affirmation, specific elements should transfer to Commit Phase. The complete promise specification including action, timeline, success criteria, and domain mapping provides the foundation for installation. The ABDUCTIO assessment and any decomposition work inform what installation will emphasize—promises with identified bottlenecks may require particular attention to those elements during installation.

The futures walkthrough and identified challenges inform installation design. If walkthrough revealed particular vulnerability points, installation should include rehearsal of navigating those challenges. If internal resistance surfaced and was resolved, installation should reinforce the integration achieved. The Pre-Commit work essentially provides the blueprint that installation follows.

The commitment affirmation moment ideally occurs within proximity to the installation session, typically hours or at most a few days. Extended gaps between affirmation and installation allow momentum to dissipate and create space for doubt to re-emerge. The transition from Pre-Commit to Commit should feel like continuous movement rather than disconnected phases.

### Informing Post-Commit Learning

Pre-Commit assessment creates baseline expectations that Post-Commit evaluation can compare against. The credence and confidence estimates provide calibration targets—did the promise succeed or fail as anticipated? If outcomes differed significantly from Pre-Commit expectations, what accounts for the discrepancy? Was capacity assessment inaccurate? Did circumstances change unexpectedly? Did installation prove more or less effective than anticipated?

The ABDUCTIO decomposition and identified assumptions become targets for learning extraction. Which assumptions proved accurate and which required revision? Which decomposition elements represented genuine bottlenecks and which proved less significant than anticipated? This learning feeds forward to future Pre-Commit assessment, progressively improving the accuracy of commitment decisions.

The Pre-Commit documentation also provides accountability for promise scope and intention. During Post-Commit reflection, the practitioner can verify whether they kept the promise as specified or whether drift occurred. Sometimes practitioners unconsciously modify commitments during execution to make them easier, then claim success based on the modified version. Pre-Commit documentation prevents this revision by maintaining clear record of original specification.

## Conclusion

The Pre-Commit Phase provides essential foundation for promise-making that enhances rather than undermines agency. The phase's structured triage separates intentions worth committing to from those better held lightly or pursued through different mechanisms. The promise architecture work transforms vague intentions into specifications precise enough for installation and verification while maintaining flexibility appropriate to the domain.

The integration of ABDUCTIO provides epistemic rigor that surfaces the difference between genuine confidence and wishful thinking. The two-number assessment reveals when apparent certainty masks hidden fragility, allowing investigation before commitment rather than discovering problems through predictable failure. The decomposition and bottleneck identification focus attention on specific elements requiring validation rather than general anxiety about whether commitments will work.

The coherence checks—both internal and external—prevent promises that would conflict with other commitments, values, or circumstances in ways that create predictable failure. These checks honor the complexity of human psychology and life circumstances rather than pretending that good intentions and strong willpower can overcome any obstacle.

The Pre-Commit Phase requires investment of time and cognitive effort that initially feels cumbersome compared to simply deciding to commit and proceeding. However, this investment pays returns through higher promise-keeping rates, prevented failures that would damage confidence, and progressive improvement in commitment decision quality. Practitioners who maintain Pre-Commit discipline develop increasingly accurate intuition about which promises warrant making and how to structure those commitments for success.

The phase establishes the foundation upon which Commit Phase installation and Post-Commit execution depend. Without adequate Pre-Commit work, installation attempts to embed poorly specified commitments that were inappropriate from the start, producing failures that reflect inadequate foundation rather than insufficient willpower or installation skill. The complete three-phase cycle functions as integrated system where each phase depends on the others being executed well.

Pre-Commit discipline distinguishes the Agency Protocol from approaches that treat commitment as simple decision to pursue particular goals. The framework recognizes that commitment quality determines outcomes more reliably than commitment quantity or execution intensity. Making fewer, better-founded promises produces more agency development than making numerous poorly-assessed commitments that fail and generate discouragement.

The phase's emphasis on honest assessment over reassuring confirmation reflects the framework's broader commitment to developing genuine capability rather than comfortable self-deception. Practitioners serve their own flourishing by declining to promise when assessment reveals inadequate foundation, by acknowledging capacity limits rather than pretending they don't exist, and by addressing internal conflicts rather than attempting to override them through force. This honest foundation creates the stability from which sustainable growth emerges.
