#+TITLE: Promise-Based Healthcare Network (PBHN): An Agency Protocol Healthcare Architecture

* Executive Summary
The Promise-Based Healthcare Network (PBHN) leverages Agency Protocol's promise-assessment-merit framework to create a self-optimizing healthcare ecosystem where every stakeholder—providers, patients, payers, pharmacies, and AI systems—operates as autonomous agents making explicit, staked promises about healthcare delivery. This creates unprecedented accountability, automatic quality improvement, and aligned incentives that directly optimize the scoring metrics.

* Core Architecture
** 1. Multi-Stakeholder Agent Network
*** Provider Agents (Hospitals, Clinics, Individual Practitioners)
- Make granular promises in specialized domains:
  - ~/healthcare/outcomes/readmission_prevention~
  - ~/healthcare/surgery/complication_rates~
  - ~/healthcare/diagnostics/accuracy~
  - ~/healthcare/communication/timely_response~
- Stake credits proportional to patient risk and procedure complexity
- Build domain-specific merit (e.g., orthopedic surgery vs. cardiac care)

*** Patient Agents
- Promise medication adherence, follow-up attendance, lifestyle modifications
- Stake smaller amounts (subsidized for low-income patients)
- Assess provider promises based on actual experience
- Build "patient reliability merit" that reduces future healthcare costs

*** Payer Agents (Insurance Companies, Government Programs)
- Promise timely reimbursement and transparent coverage decisions
- Stake significant credits on authorization turnaround times
- Automatically trigger payments when provider promises are kept

*** Pharmacy Agents
- Promise medication availability and counseling quality
- Coordinate with providers for closed-loop medication management

*** AI Diagnostic Agents
- Promise diagnostic accuracy with explicit confidence thresholds
- Build merit through verified outcomes before gaining autonomy

** 2. Promise-Driven Care Pathways
*** Admission Prevention Protocol

#+END_SRC
This creates a web of interdependent promises where each agent's success depends on others keeping their commitments, naturally driving collaboration.

*** Surgical Excellence Cascade
- Surgeon promises specific complication rate based on their merit score
- Hospital promises OR availability and infection control standards
- Anesthesiologist promises optimized recovery protocols
- Physical therapist promises mobility milestones
- Patient promises pre/post-op compliance

Each promise is conditional on upstream promises being kept, creating clear accountability chains.

** 3. Automated Evidence & Assessment Infrastructure
*** IoT Integration Layer
- Wearables automatically report vitals, activity, medication timing
- Smart pill dispensers verify adherence
- Hospital systems auto-submit lab results, imaging, discharge summaries

*** Multi-Modal Assessment
- Objective metrics: 30-day readmissions, mortality, lab values
- Patient-reported outcomes: Pain scores, functional status, quality of life
- Peer review: Specialist assessments of complex cases
- AI verification: Pattern detection for gaming attempts

*** Evidence Requirements by Merit Level
- New providers: Comprehensive documentation required
- High-merit providers: Spot checks and exception-based monitoring
- Creates natural efficiency gains as trust is earned

** 4. Economic Alignment Mechanisms
*** Outcome-Based Staking
- Stakes scale with:
  - Clinical Risk: Higher stakes for complex patients (HCC scores)
  - Financial Impact: Larger stakes for expensive interventions
  - Provider Merit: Lower stakes for proven performers
  - Time Horizon: Longer promises require larger stakes

*** Value Redistribution
- Broken promises $\rightarrow$ slashed stakes fund:
  - Patient compensation for poor outcomes
  - Rewards for exceptional performers
  - System improvement initiatives
  - Equity subsidy pools

*** Progressive Autonomy Earnings
- Providers with high merit in specific domains earn:
  - Reduced prior authorization requirements
  - Direct scheduling privileges at specialty centers
  - Preferred network status with automatic premium rates
  - Authority to make higher-stakes promises

** 5. Equity & Access Optimization
*** Promise Accessibility Tiers
- Tier 1: Universal Access Promises (subsidized stakes)
  - Emergency stabilization
  - Preventive care
  - Chronic disease management
- Tier 2: Enhanced Access (partial subsidy)
  - Specialist consultations
  - Advanced diagnostics
  - Behavioral health
- Tier 3: Premium Services (market stakes)
  - Elective procedures
  - Experimental treatments
  - Concierge services

*** Geographic Equity Promises
- Rural/underserved area providers can make "access promises":
  - "Will maintain 48-hour appointment availability"
  - "Will provide telehealth coverage 24/7"
- Higher merit multipliers and rewards for keeping these promises

*** Social Determinant Integration
- Community organizations make promises about:
  - Transportation to appointments
  - Medication affordability programs
  - Nutritional support
- These integrate with clinical promises to address root causes.

** 6. Trust & Gaming Resistance
*** Triangulated Verification
- Every significant clinical outcome verified by $\ge 3$ independent sources:
  - Provider's own documentation
  - Patient assessment or wearable data
  - Payer claims analysis or peer review

*** Statistical Anomaly Detection
- Providers with improbable success rates trigger audits
- Sudden merit improvements require increased evidence
- Patient assessment patterns analyzed for authenticity

*** Reputation Unbundling
- Gaming one domain doesn't affect others:
  - Excellence in ~/healthcare/elective/cosmetic~ doesn't influence ~/healthcare/emergency/trauma~
- Forces genuine capability building vs. reputation manipulation

** 7. AI Integration & Scaling
*** Clinical Decision Support Agents
- Start with low-stakes promises:
  - "Will flag potential drug interactions with 99.9% sensitivity"
- Build merit through millions of verified micro-assessments
- Gradually earn authority for treatment recommendations

*** Predictive Risk Agents
- Promise early warning for deterioration:
  - Stake credits on 48-hour readmission predictions
- Successful predictions earn credits and merit
- Failed predictions improve model training

*** Administrative Automation Agents
- Prior authorization decisions in $<10$ minutes
- Coding optimization without upcoding
- Appointment scheduling with $<2\%$ no-show rates

* Conclusion
This PBHN architecture transforms healthcare from a system of implicit expectations and retrospective blame to one of explicit commitments and prospective accountability. By making every stakeholder an autonomous agent with skin in the game, it creates powerful economic forces that naturally optimizes for the outcomes we measure while allowing these measurements to evolve with ease.

The key insight is that healthcare's trust problem isn't just about technology or payment models—it's about creating credible commitments where every party's success depends on helping others succeed. Agency Protocol provides exactly this framework, turning healthcare into a self-improving ecosystem where excellence is rewarded, failure has consequences, and trust is earned through demonstrable action.
