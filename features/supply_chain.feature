Feature: Supply Chain Transparency and Traceability
  As a supply chain network
  We want to establish verifiable trust between participants
  So that we can ensure quality, sustainability, and ethical practices

  Background:
    Given a decentralized network of supply chain participants exists
    And participants can make verifiable promises about their operations
    And each promise can be assessed by relevant stakeholders
    And merit accumulates in specific supply chain domains
    And participants must be vouched for by existing trusted members

  Scenario: Raw Material Supplier Joining Network
    Given an organic cotton farmer "GreenCotton" wants to join the network
    And established supplier "EcoFiber" has high merit in "sustainable_cotton"
    When "EcoFiber" vouches for "GreenCotton"
    Then a vouching statement is created containing:
      | Field           | Value                                           |
      | Voucher        | EcoFiber's address                             |
      | Vouched For    | GreenCotton's address                         |
      | Domain         | sustainable_cotton                             |
      | Stake          | 25% of EcoFiber's domain merit                |
      | Evidence       | On-site audit reports, certification records   |
    And "GreenCotton" must make initial promises:
      | Promise Type          | Promise Content                                   |
      | Organic Certification | Maintain organic certification status            |
