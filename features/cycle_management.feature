Feature: Cycle Detection and Management
  Ensure that the system prevents and manages cyclic dependencies among agents and promises to maintain system integrity and trust.

  Background:
    Given the system has a Cycle Detector component
    And the Cycle Detector can analyze inheritance and promise dependency graphs
    And the system maintains an inheritance graph and a promise dependency graph

  Scenario: Detecting Inheritance Cycles
    Given Agent A inherits from Agent B
    And Agent B inherits from Agent C
    When Agent C attempts to inherit from Agent A
    Then the Cycle Detector should identify a cycle involving Agent A, Agent B, and Agent C
    And the inheritance assignment should be rejected
    And Agent C should be notified of the cycle detection

  Scenario: Detecting Promise Dependency Cycles
    Given Promise P1 depends on Promise P2
    And Promise P2 depends on Promise P3
    When Promise P3 attempts to depend on Promise P1
    Then the Cycle Detector should identify a cycle involving Promise P1, Promise P2, and Promise P3
    And the promise dependency should be rejected
    And the agent responsible for Promise P3 should be notified of the cycle detection

  Scenario: Preventing Multiple Inheritance to Avoid Cycles
    Given Agent D inherits from Agent E
    And Agent E inherits from Agent F
    When Agent D attempts to inherit from Agent F
    Then the Cycle Detector should identify a potential indirect cycle
    And the inheritance assignment should be rejected
    And Agent D should be advised to review inheritance hierarchy

  Scenario: Resolving Detected Inheritance Cycles
    Given a cycle has been detected involving Agent X, Agent Y, and Agent Z
    When the system initiates cycle resolution
    Then the system should break the cycle by removing the most recent inheritance assignment
    And the system should notify Agents X, Y, and Z of the resolution action

  Scenario: Resolving Detected Promise Dependency Cycles
    Given a cycle has been detected involving Promise Q1, Promise Q2, and Promise Q3
    When the system initiates cycle resolution
    Then the system should break the cycle by removing the most recent promise dependency
    And the system should notify the agents responsible for Promise Q3 of the resolution action

  Scenario: Logging and Auditing Cycle Detection Events
    Given a cycle has been detected and resolved
    When the system processes the cycle detection event
    Then the system should log the details of the cycle including involved agents or promises
    And the system should store the resolution actions taken
