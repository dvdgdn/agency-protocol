Feature: Testable Agent Core Functionality

  Scenario: Creating a Valid Hypothesis
    Given a testable agent exists
    When a hypothesis is created with:
      | Component   | Value                                      |
      | Statement   | "X increases as Y decreases"               |
      | Variables   | Independent: X, Dependent: Y               |
      | Assumptions | ["X and Y can be measured reliably"]       |
      | Constraints | ["X and Y remain within defined bounds"]   |
    Then the hypothesis should be marked as valid
    And the agent should accept it for testing

  Scenario: Rejecting an Invalid Hypothesis
    Given a testable agent exists
    When a hypothesis is created without dependent variables
    Then the hypothesis should be marked as invalid
    And the agent should reject it for testing
    And provide specific validation errors

  Scenario: Testing a Hypothesis
    Given a testable agent exists
    And a valid hypothesis has been created
    When the agent tests the hypothesis
    Then it should generate a test result containing:
      | Component    | Value                               |
      | Outcome      | Boolean (supported/not supported)   |

    Given an LLM testable agent exists with valid configuration

    And store all prompts used in the test
    And include LLM confidence scores in the evidence

  Scenario: LLM Prompt Transparency
    Given an LLM testable agent has completed a test
    When requesting the test results
    Then all prompts used should be available for review
    And the chain of LLM reasoning should be documented
    And any limitations of the LLM approach should be noted

  Scenario: Multiple LLM Cross-Validation
    Given an LLM testable agent exists
    And a hypothesis requires high confidence
    When the agent tests the hypothesis
    Then it should use multiple LLM evaluations

      | Steps         | 100                    |
    Then each step should be executed
    And state should be tracked throughout
    And final state should be available

  Scenario: Tracking Simulation State
    Given a simulation is running
    When each step executes
    Then the agent should track:
