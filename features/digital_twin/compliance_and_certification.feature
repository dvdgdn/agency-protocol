Feature: Agency Protocol Compliance & Certification Agents
  In order to meet enterprise audit and regulatory needs
  As a Compliance Officer
  I want agents that stake on ISO-27001, SOC2, HIPAA controls and emit audit artifacts

  Background:
    Given a Compliance Agent promising “ISO-27001 Evidence Collection”
    And a Compliance Agent promising “SOC2 Report Generation”
    And a Compliance Agent promising “HIPAA Controls Enforcement”

  Scenario: Generating ISO-27001 audit report
    Given the system has registry, ingestion, snapshot, analytics events for “DT-C1”
    When the ISO-27001 Compliance Agent runs quarterly self-audit
    Then it should emit an ISO27001AuditReportEvent containing mapped controls evidence

  Scenario: Producing a SOC2 attestation package
    Given the system has 6 months of operational logs for “DT-C1”
    When the SOC2 Compliance Agent is triggered
    Then it should bundle logs, metrics and promise outcomes into a SOC2Report
    And emit a SOC2ReportGeneratedEvent

  Scenario: Enforcing HIPAA data-handling controls
    Given Twin “DT-HIPAA” processes patient data
    When the HIPAA Compliance Agent scans all data-ingestion promises
    Then it should verify encryption-at-rest, access controls, logging
    And emit a HIPAAComplianceEvent with pass=true
