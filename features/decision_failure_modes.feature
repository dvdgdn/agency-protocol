Feature: Decision Failure Mode Resolution
  Decision-making processes often fail in predictable ways
  Agency Protocol combines Consensus, Meritocratic, and Democratic mechanisms
  to address common failure modes while maintaining transparency and accountability

  Background:
    Given the system supports Consensus, Meritocratic, and Democratic Agents
    And agents have unique content-based addresses and verifiable signatures
    And merit scores exist in relevant domains for all participants
    And all actions are recorded with cryptographic verification

  @autocratic_failure
  Scenario: Preventing expert blindness in leadership decisions
    Given a project team needs to make a technical architecture decision
    And the team lead has high organizational authority but low domain merit
    And team member Alice has exceptional merit in the relevant domain
    When the team initiates a merit-weighted consensus process
    Then Alice's contributions are weighted higher than the lead's
    And the final decision reflects domain expertise rather than organizational hierarchy
    And all contributions remain in the immutable record for future reference
    And organizational authority is respected while expert blindness is mitigated

  @autocratic_failure
  Scenario: Overcoming information bottlenecks
    Given a leadership team is making a strategic decision
    And critical information is distributed across different departments
    And some department heads are withholding unfavorable data
    When a Consensus Agent initiates the decision process with data sharing promises
    Then participants stake credits on their information sharing promises
    And breaking these promises would result in merit and credit loss
    And the Democratic Agent enables anonymous whistleblowing with ZKPs
    And the complete information environment leads to a better-informed decision

  @consultative_failure
  Scenario: Detecting and preventing pseudo-consultation
    Given a manager regularly asks for team input but rarely incorporates it
    And this has created team cynicism about participation
    When the manager makes a promise to meaningfully consider team input
    Then this promise creates an assessable commitment with staked credits
    And team members can assess whether their input was genuinely considered
    And repeated negative assessments reduce the manager's merit in the leadership domain
    And the system creates a verifiable record of consultation patterns over time

  @consultative_failure
  Scenario: Eliminating cherry-picked feedback
    Given an organization is evaluating a controversial new policy
    And leadership is inclined to selectively incorporate supporting feedback
    When the Consensus Agent structures the feedback process
    Then all feedback is permanently recorded with cryptographic signatures
    And matrix factorization identifies when only aligned feedback is incorporated
    And participants can verify that the decision addressed diverse perspectives
    And selective incorporation patterns damage decision-maker merit scores

  @majority_rule_failure
  Scenario: Addressing tyranny of the majority
    Given a diverse team is making a decision that affects all members
    And an underrepresented group has significant concerns
    When the Democratic Agent processes the vote
    Then matrix factorization identifies faction-based voting patterns
    And the Consensus Agent promotes solutions with cross-factional support
    And merit weighting ensures domain experts have appropriate influence
    And the final decision incorporates minority protections despite majority power

  @majority_rule_failure
  Scenario: Preventing superficial analysis in voting
    Given a complex technical decision requires detailed understanding
    And many voting participants lack domain expertise
    When the Meritocratic Agent evaluates the voting process
    Then votes are weighted by domain-specific merit rather than simple counting
    And assessments require credit staking proportional to confidence
    And low-merit participants can defer to high-merit experts
    And the resulting decision reflects deep analysis rather than superficial preferences

  @consent_failure
  Scenario: Addressing last-minute objection syndrome
    Given a team is finalizing a decision after weeks of consultation
    And team member Bob raises fundamental objections at the final meeting
    When the Consensus Agent processes this objection
    Then the system retrieves the complete participation history
    And identifies that Bob had multiple earlier opportunities to raise concerns
    And applies time-decay weighting to late objections without good cause
    And the final record notes the timing pattern for future merit calculations

  @consent_failure
  Scenario: Overcoming conflict avoidance
    Given a team tends to avoid direct disagreement due to cultural norms
    And this has led to superficial agreement masking real concerns
    When the Democratic Agent enables anonymous voting with ZKPs
    Then team members can express honest opinions without fear
    And the matrix factorization algorithm detects hidden agreement patterns
    And the system encourages specific, constructive objections through merit rewards
    And the resulting decision surfaces and addresses previously hidden concerns

  @consensus_failure
  Scenario: Preventing paralysis by perfection
    Given a team is stuck trying to achieve 100% agreement on every detail
    And the decision timeline is extending well beyond reasonable limits
    When the Meritocratic Agent is activated with time-bound authority
    Then decision authority is delegated based on domain-specific merit
    And the delegation includes explicit scope and time limitations
    And the Democratic Agent maintains the right to override if necessary
    And the team achieves timely decisions while preserving appropriate consent

  @consensus_failure
  Scenario: Detecting and addressing false consensus
    Given team members publicly agree with a proposal despite private reservations
    And social pressure prevents honest expression of concerns
    When the Consensus Agent implements private voting with ZKPs
    Then participants can express honest opinions without social consequences
    And the matrix factorization algorithm detects when public and private votes diverge
    And the system flags potential false consensus situations
    And facilitators can address the underlying issues without exposing individuals

  @cross_cutting_failure
  Scenario: Neutralizing hidden power dynamics
    Given an organization has both formal and informal power structures
    And some members have disproportionate influence despite limited expertise
    When decisions are processed through the Agency Protocol system
    Then the Meritocratic Agent weights input based on demonstrated expertise
    And the Democratic Agent maintains equality in procedural rights
    And the Consensus Agent ensures all voices are heard and considered
    And matrix factorization detects and neutralizes voting blocks based on power

  @cross_cutting_failure
  Scenario: Matching decision methods to appropriate situations
    Given different decisions require different levels of consensus and speed
    And organizations often apply one-size-fits-all decision processes
    When the Agency Protocol system is configured for a decision
    Then domain-specific protocols determine the appropriate decision mechanism:
      | Decision Type     | Primary Agent    | Secondary Agent  | Threshold    |
      | Crisis response   | Meritocratic     | Democratic       | Low          |
      | Strategic vision  | Consensus        | Meritocratic     | High         |
      | Technical details | Meritocratic     | Consensus        | Medium       |
      | Value conflicts   | Democratic       | Consensus        | High         |
    And the system adapts procedures to decision significance and time sensitivity
    And the immutable record creates learning opportunities for process improvement

  @advanced_integration
  Scenario: Seamless transition between decision modes
    Given a complex decision process that evolves over time
    And different phases require different decision approaches
    When the process begins with broad Consensus Agent coordination
    Then it can transition to Meritocratic Agent delegation for implementation details
    And the Democratic Agent provides oversight and emergency intervention capability
    And transitions between modes are explicitly recorded with justifications
    And the system maintains coherence across the full decision lifecycle
    And participants understand their role in each phase through explicit promises

  @advanced_integration
  Scenario: Creating credible commitment mechanisms
    Given diverse stakeholders need assurance that decisions will be implemented
    And past experiences have led to skepticism about follow-through
    When decisions are recorded as formal promises with staked credits
    Then implementation becomes an assessable commitment
    And stakeholders can verify progress through objective metrics
    And failure to implement incurs merit and credit penalties
    And the system creates trust through verifiable commitment rather than just good intentions
